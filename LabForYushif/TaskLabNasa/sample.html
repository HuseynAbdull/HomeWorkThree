    <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the <br> world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a <br>round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is <br> no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which <br> all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be <br> truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
    <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good <br> and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings <br>about technological dangers also come from science.</p>
    <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set <br>foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.</p>
    <p>A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon <br>seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's <br>how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and <br>cherish her.</p>
    <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and <br>perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes <br>your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more <br>valuable than those which divide us.</p>

    <h2>The Final Frontier</h2>
    
    <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both <br>figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no <br>matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just <br>beginning.</p>

    <blockquote>The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. <br>Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next <br>year and yet far too little for the next ten.</blockquote>
    <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or <br>even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying <br>out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
    
    <h2>Reaching for the Stars</h2>
    <p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size.<br>Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can <br>imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, <br>that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing <br>this has to change a man.</p>

    <span>To go places and do things that have never been done before - that’s what living is all about.</span>

    <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. <br>Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life <br>and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>
    <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of <br>realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and <br>this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
